# Data Availability Statement for "The Timing Versus Allocation Trade-off in Politically Constrained Climate Policies"

By: Adam Michael Bauer -- adammb4 [at] illinois [dot] edu

This directory contains a set of codes that reproduces all of the figures and analysis carried out in: *The Timing Versus Allocation Trade-off in Politically Constrained Climate Policies* by Bauer, Hallegatte, and McIsaac.

To cite our working paper that uses these codes: [Bauer, A. M., S. Hallegatte, F. McIsaac. *The Timing Versus Allocation Trade-off in Politically Constrained Climate Policies*. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series, No. XXXXX, The World Bank, Washington DC, 2024.](https://www.ambauer.com)

All of the data used in our study is taken and/or interpreted from publically available publications and reports. Raw data is used to calibrate the numerical model. Individual numbers used in the simulations can be found in the `codes/data/cal/` files for each simulation. All values are taken from the following papers or reports:

- Data for the remaining carbon budget and its uncertainty is taken from [Friedlingstein *et al.*, *Earth System Science Data*, 2023](https://www.essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/5301/2023/). 
- Marginal investment cost data is taken from [Bauer *et al.*, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 10473, 2024.](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099829103282438373/idu1f2d86d77127091490d1a6df1dc342f15d10b)
- Capital depreciation rates are taken from [Philibert, C., 2007](https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20962174), see Figure 8. The capital depreciation rate is the inverse of the capital lifetime.
- The social discount rate is taken from [Drupp *et al.*, 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20160240), their median estimate.
